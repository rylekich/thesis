					<p>Abigail Lucien, Asma Asma Asma Asma + Anamorphic Painting</p>
					<p>
						Each of these works are highly ornamental, menacing, and feminine that evoke an older time. (The anamorphic painting being of the 17-18th ct whereas the other two were made in the last 2 years). They are all gates or structures that feel narrative and suggested that something is awry in one way or another.

					<p>Gran Fury</p>
					<p>
						The work of this collective focused on passing as legitimate objects that criticized the government's lack of support for people with AIDS. Their work used graphic design methodologies to blend in seamlessly within advertising, publishing, civic signage. This form of camoflage relies on mimicry, and hiding in plain sight.

					<p> Lorna by Lynn Hershmann-Leeson</p>
					<p>
						I am interested in hybrid digital and physical experiences — what one can do to amplify the other. the IRL / AFK. This piece Lorna by LHL was an early work on this interior/exterior life that we could in a contemporary sense understand as a social media vs. everyday presence. Lorna specifically is a character that is agoraphobic, and wont leave her LA apartment in which she compulsively watches the onslaught of bad news on TV. The installation is meant to mock her domestic home, and you make choices for Lorna through an interactive CD-ROM game.

					<p> Surveillance Shoe by Jill Magid</p>
					<p>
						"The Surveillance Shoe is a hybridization of surveillance hardware and a pair of high-heeled shoes. A CCD surveillance camera with infrared technology is built into the shoe's design." <br><br>
						
						I like this flipping of gaze, and literal POV of turning the world upside down. The aesthetics of both the shoe ovject and the video that was made with this shoe are evocative of the erotic thriller. The mix of threatening and sexy remind me of predatorial tactics — to lure prey into a trap. While some of the works I am attracted to come from a place of self-defense and hiding, others use similar tactics to attack. The criticality here seems to lie in that she is also using things that readily exist and already occur (sexy heels, cctvs + constant surveillance), but to take it in her own hands has a more illicit connotation.

					<p> Flexi-Shield (Eostra), 2019, Amy Brener + Duchamp's Box in a Valise and Curiosity Cabinet</p>
					<p>
						Another tie to form — this is a siliscon cast "bodice" or armor with small compartments that hold tiny collected objects. While it is not explicitly meant to be worn it suggests it could be — it reads as wearable cabinet. <br><br>
						This actual cabinet of curiosities from the mid 17th century is a little treasure chest of discovery — at the time meant as a way for rich people to display little trinkets that they wouldve acquired while travelling. I like this method of displaying/discovering a collection. <br><br>
						The Duchamp piece is another example of collecting a myriad of things into a box with many compartments.
					</p>

				<li>
					<p>Carmen Winant. My Birth. 2018.</p>
					<p>
						My particular interest in this piece is in its formal qualities. It's a diagramatic wall sculpture to physically tie these images together. Its form connotes a mobile, a family tree, a windchime. It is sturdy, confidently built.
					</p>

					<p>Still from Nowhere by Gregg Araki</p>
					<p>"Described as "Beverly Hills 90210 on acid", the film follows a day in the lives of a group of Los Angeles college students and the strange lives that they lead." This is Rachel True on the phone in her character's room. A hidden image, transparency, and now this method of distraction— camoflage. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>Elspeth Diederix, Transparent Still Life 2002 + Deiopea comb jelly</p>
					<p>
						In the same vein of obscurity, being fully transparent — or the performance of being such— is an intriguing form of superficiality and closed-off-ness. There is a general elusiveness of this image. It is a still life of everyday objects: the material, the physics, and the setting in which its placed is what makes it off-putting and seductive. <br><br>
						This comb jelly is mostly transparent but emits bioluminescent light that can be both used to attract mates or to counterilluminate itself and hide from prey.
					</p>

				<li>
					<p>Spectogram, "Wikipedia" image hidden in an audio file</p>
					<p>
						I've been looking at different ways to hide and obscure information. I'm not interested in cmoplete obfuscation or I wouldnt make things at all — I want them to be accessible through some sort of cipher. This is an image hidden inside of an audio file — this would be accessible when you open the audio file in its appropriate program.
					</p>
				</li>


				<li>
					<p>The cardio solaric cyclopad-work from home as you get fit and tan (2004) by Mika Rottenberg</p>
					<p>The absurdity of the image itself and what it is portraying is what I gravitate towards in this piece. as modern workers, we are expected to multitask but to hide the visual evidence of the toll or chaos it creates. The working as well as visual maintenance here is very visible. </p>
