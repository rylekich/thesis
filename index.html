        <h1>Nothing Important</h1>

        <p>The promise of transparency is that seeing is knowing. Despite the presence of creative license in the making of images, the documentation of sight becomes factual evidence. Sight is realized through lenses, processed, and developed into negatives and digital files that cosplay legitimacy by their transmutation into photographs. While evidence lays bare a “complete” picture, showing a vast collection of things can be a way of obfuscating: the flattened hierarchy confuses while simulating <a href="#superficial-errata" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="errata-ref">accessibility</a>.  In most of my work, I accumulate information and imagery from disparate sources and create meaning through compilation and <a href="#immaterial" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="immaterial-ref">association</a>. I start with text and images from others, arranging materials with seeming objectivity while covertly dispersing my content amongst theirs. My authorship is found in the footnote, my perspective proposed through assemblage. These physical citations export and validate my perception, showing others a constructed version of how I’d like to be known. However, identifying oneself can be a fixed and therefore vulnerable position.</p>

        <p>The omniscient eye draws power through survey, and distinguishing yourself amid the noise makes you susceptible to scrutiny. Being observed tokenizes and flattens subjects into their representations, reducing them to their <a href="#chilleando" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="chill-ref">depictions.</a> <a href="#twobridges" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="twobridge-ref"></a>  What you see is what you get. Objects and documents are references that act as relics to signal other things; like memory, or the people who owned those objects, causing objecthood and subjecthood to  <a href="#grammyshouse" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="grammys-ref">conflate.</a> <a href="#laguardia" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="lag-ref"></a>  By including versions in my final works, I prioritize rendering over representation: the shapeshifting states of loading, melting, and becoming reject solidity and disguise via complexity. I command my image — the mechanics of looking, and the methods of presentation and display are sites of <a href="#stereo" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="stereo-ref">intervention.</a> In Glissant’s defense of opacity he acknowledges that there is shelter in chaos. I reckon with visibility by employing flamboyant camouflage and visual <a href="#darnell" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="darnell-ref">clutter.</a> <a href="#paulrand" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="rand-ref"></a>  Camouflage can take the form of a ruffle or a ribbon. Decoration makes objects appear non-threatening.
        </p> 

        <p>Implicated within systems of control, I make do by using distraction techniques and loopholes. I’m interested in surveillance and its relation to sex, labor, and imaging the feminized <a href="#smile" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="smile-ref">body.</a>  Bureaucracy and filibustering show how words can act as a façade, meant not to be read but to <a href="#paparazzi" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="paps-ref">obstruct.</a> The infrastructural, financial and technological systems that shape our lives are often invisible: they lie in signals transmitted through air, code, and meetings held in <a href="#mechbull" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="bull-ref">private.</a> Immateriality is a site of both cloaked power and historically undervalued <a href="#girl6" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="girl6-ref">work.</a> Service and domestic sectors are taken for granted because this work is expected and largely unseen. Jobs in technology, while also immaterial, are often opaque in what those roles entail affording an assumption of importance. These bifurcated industries share a resistance to tangibility, but being indecipherable can render you powerful or powerless.</p>

                        The Taíno word “Hamaka” was loaned into the Spanish “Hamaca” until anglicized into “Hammock” — the shift of the word follows the object’s trajectory from a tool of necessity to a symbol of leisure.

                        <h3 class="cite-title">Females </h3> by Andrea Long Chu
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In making work on the feminine, I cite Andrea Long Chu’s definition of the female. “Femaleness is a universal sex defined by self-negation” — or making yourself vacuous for the needs of others. “Getting fucked makes you female because fucked is what a female is.” The mother and the martyr are selfless archetypes of the feminine that permeate culture and I often think of these symbols and aesthetics when approaching my work.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Politics of Art: Contemporary Art and the Transition to Post-Democracy, Steyerl speaks to how art often operates as a cover or a front: whether its to act as money laundering objects, or how art masks the very capitalist frameworks that entrench society at large. I read this in relation to Sigfried Kracauer’s The Mass Ornament where Steyrel calls artists and art workers strike workers — a term derived from the Soviet Union to refer to excess laborers. In a contemporary sense: “Strike workers churn out feelings, perception, and distinction in all possible sizes and variations. Intensity or evacuation, sublime or crap, readymade or ready made reality—strike work supplies consumers with all they never knew they wanted.”

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Graphic design is a feminized labor role as it falls within the service industry; designers are intermediaries between clients and the public. Through project intake, listening, interpreting, and incorporating feedback into exported goods, a designer listens to, cares about, and provides for their clients the way a waiter or a cashier might. Jaramillo talks about women who perform ASMR on youtube and connects them to performance artists, phone sex operators, domestic workers, uniting these typical feminized labors under the same umbrella: through the services they provide. I think designers could interchangeably be inserted into this essay as the labor of design largely has an affective interpersonal role, and requires you to be a secretary, project manager, and accommodator — the designed product is the least of the work.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bioluminescence is a biological development that allows certain deep sea creatures to counter-illuminate themselves as a form of camouflage from predators. This same ability also works to entice, and lure prey in. The superficial ability to emit light from the skin works as inspiration for me in thinking of human forms of flamboyant camouflage and hiding in plain sight. Tavi Meraud speaks about a similar phenomenon in the qualities of iridescence and the superficial that I took inspiration from in thinking about bioluminescence.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Glissant defends colonial subjects' rights to opacity and refusal of being understood as a means of self defense. To be known is to be vulnerable to attack, to be reduced and flattened in order to be understood. He is talking about stereotypes and their harm. Being opaque is self preservation in communities that speak their own languages.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wendy talks about the history of programming and how software used to *be* people, and now it is computation that allows for people to code. Wendy argues Computation, or how a computer works, must be made opaque in order for people to use it and to communicate with each other which ironically is what allows for a “seemingly transparent” culture between people. Open lines of communication are afforded by computers opaque inner workings. This writing is about the politics transparency, coding, feminization, and technology.
